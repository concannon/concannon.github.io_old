      <description>Bad Religion is a punk band that formed in the Los Angeles area in the early 1980s and continues to make great music and tour today. Since hearing their music almost 20 years ago, I have been an avid follower. Over the course of 30 plus years, and over 20 albums, there are a wealth of lyrics to digest. And this is no ordinary punk band - the group deserves and relishes in the label of thesaurus punk.</description>
