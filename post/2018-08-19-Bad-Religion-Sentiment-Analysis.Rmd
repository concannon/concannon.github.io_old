Bad Religion is a punk band that formed in the Los Angeles area in the early 1980s and continues to make great music and tour today.  Since hearing their music almost 20 years ago, I have been an avid follower.  Over the course of 30 plus years, and over 20 albums, there are a wealth of lyrics to digest.  And this is no ordinary punk band - the group deserves and relishes in the label of [thesaurus punk](https://music.avclub.com/where-to-begin-with-the-thesaurus-punk-of-bad-religion-1798278095).  What other band can work in terms like 'trammel', 'entropy', and 'fecundity' at 120 beats per minute?  This seemed like a perfect opportunity to put Julia Silge and David Robinson's book [Tidy Text Mining with R](http://tidytextmining.com) to use.

## Top Words by Sentiment

With a name like Bad Religion, I wasn't expecting many positive words.  Terms like wrong, dead/die, lie, bad, etc. top the list. The words designated as positive are not much better.  Usually, when a song includes a word like 'modern' it actually isn't in a positive context - such as 'modern man, evolutionary destroyer'.  
```{r}

brtidy <- b %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word,lyrics) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) 


brsen <- brtidy %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) 


brsen %>%
  count(word,sentiment,sort=T) %>% 
  top_n(n=20) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(Word=reorder(word,n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Word,n,fill=sentiment))+
  geom_col()+
  facet_wrap(~sentiment,scales='free_y')+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_ipsum_tw(grid='none')+
  theme(legend.position='none')+
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete=T)+
  labs(title='Top 20 Bad Religion Lyrics by Sentiment')
  

```



## TF-IDF

[Term frequency inverse document frequency](https://www.tidytextmining.com/tfidf.html#the-bind_tf_idf-function) (TF-IDF) is a technique used to find important words in a particular document - or song in this case.  The results of the tf-idf calculation grouped by album are also not surprising.  Most of the top words are used in the chorus of songs on that album - and thus repeated many times.  
```{r,fig.width=10,fig.height=15}


brwords <- brtidy %>% 
  count(word,album,sort=T)
total_words <- brwords %>% 
  group_by(album) %>% 
  summarise(total=sum(n))

total_words

brwords <- left_join(brwords,total_words) %>% 
  bind_tf_idf(word,album,n)

#brwords %>% arrange(-tf_idf) %>% View()

brwords %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf)) %>%
  mutate(word = factor(word, levels = rev(unique(word)))) %>% 
  group_by(album) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(total>500) %>% 
  top_n(5) %>% 
  ungroup %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf, fill = tf_idf)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "tf-idf") +
  theme_ipsum_tw(grid='none')+
  theme(legend.position='none')+
  scale_fill_viridis()+
  facet_wrap(~album, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()

```


## Wordcloud

It had to be done.  I am not surprised by any of the high-frequency words in this plot.  Many of Bad Religion's songs cover heady topics like conquering the world, finding truth, and the meaning of life.

```{r}
pal <- brewer.pal(6,"PRGn")

brtidy %>% 
  count(word) %>% 
  with(wordcloud(word,n,max.words=250,colors=pal))






```


## Sentiment Across Albums

This plot is the result of a calculation to derive the aggregate sentiment score (positive words minus negative words) across albums.  No album had a positive sentiment score - though I doubt 'Grandiloquent' is in the Bing sentiment dictionary!  That 'Stranger than Fiction' was the album with the lowest sentiment score makes sense - I believe this album was released in the wake of some turmoil between two of the founding members.
```{r}



brtidy %>% 
  filter(!album %in% c('Short Music For Short People','Punk Rock Song','Tested','Punk-O-Rama 8','Punk Rock Songs (The Epic Years)')) %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>% 
  count(album,sentiment) %>% 
  spread(sentiment,n,fill=0) %>% 
  mutate(sentiment=positive-negative) %>%
  mutate(album=reorder(album,sentiment)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(album,sentiment,fill=sentiment))+geom_bar(stat='identity')+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_ipsum_tw(grid='none')+
  theme(legend.position='none')+
  labs(title='Bad Religion Albums by Aggregate Sentiment')
  






```



## N-Grams

The tables show the highest frequency word pairs across the corpus.  Again, many of these bigrams are found in the chorus, and their high frequency makes sense.
```{r}


bigrams <- b %>% 
  unnest_tokens(bigram,lyrics,token='ngrams',n=2) 

bigrams %>% 
  separate(bigram, c('word1','word2'),sep=" ") %>% 
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>% 
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word) %>% 
  count(word1, word2, sort=T)

bigrams %>% 
  count(bigram,sort=T)





```
